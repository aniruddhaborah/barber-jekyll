Our EP - Spring 2020 is out now on all platforms.

We wrote this EP during the lockdown, 2020. Many of us stayed at home, some lost jobs, others moved out of Canada, and still others lost loved ones to COVID. 

We wrote these songs to help live out our days in isolation, as well as to empathize with and memorialize the times we are living through.
