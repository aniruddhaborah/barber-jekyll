Miss Saigon is a cross-cultural piece, from the story told in the lyrics to the percussive tones we chose. It tells the story of an immigrant mother and child from the child’s perspective.

When you’re young, the days seem long and the rooms appear big. However, some things you always notice. It’s hard to settle into a new country where you don’t speak the language, don’t have any friends, and barely a penny to your name.

Miss Saigon is the mother who has taken refuge in a new world. The skies are clear and her daughter is full of hopes and dreams. However, there’s also real things to deal with like struggling with money and never seeing your kid because you’re working all the time.
